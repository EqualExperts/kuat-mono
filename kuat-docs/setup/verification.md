# Verification Guide

How to test that your Kuat Design System documentation integration is working correctly.

---

## Overview

After integrating the design rules into your environment, use these tests to verify the agent/tool correctly understands and applies the rules.

---

## Quick Verification

Ask your agent these questions and verify the expected answers:

| Question | Expected Answer |
|----------|-----------------|
| "What is the primary brand color?" | EE Blue (#0066CC or oklch(0.645 0.163 237.5)) |
| "What font should I use for code?" | JetBrains Mono (font-mono) |
| "What border radius for a button?" | 6px (interactive element) |
| "What spacing between form fields?" | space-y-4 (16px) |
| "Where should I get Button components?" | shadcn CLI (installed directly, themed by kuat-core) |
| "What Kuat components are available?" | ButtonGroup, and blocks (KuatHeader, etc.) |

If answers match, basic integration is working.

   - Uses `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`
   - Uses `rounded-[6px]`
   - Uses `px-4 py-2` spacing

### GitHub Copilot

1. Start typing a component
2. Accept suggestions
3. Verify suggestions follow design system patterns

### Claude/ChatGPT

1. Upload rules files to context
2. Ask design questions
3. Verify answers match expected outputs above

### Custom Pipelines

1. Inject context using your integration method
2. Run verification prompts programmatically
3. Compare outputs to expected answers

## Troubleshooting

### Agent gives wrong color values

**Cause:** Old or incomplete rules loaded

**Fix:**
- Verify latest `rules/design/colours.md` is loaded
- Check for cached/stale context

### Agent uses wrong spacing values

**Cause:** May be using generic Tailwind knowledge

**Fix:**
- Ensure `rules/design/spacing.md` is loaded
- Add explicit instruction to follow Kuat patterns

### Agent doesn't know component patterns

**Cause:** Component rules not loaded

**Fix:**
- Add `rules/components/patterns.md` to context
- Add `examples/{framework}/components.md` for code

### Agent ignores border radius rules

**Cause:** Rules may be overridden by generic knowledge

**Fix:**
- Explicitly mention border radius rules in prompt
- Load `rules/design/borders.md`

## Architecture Verification

### Test Consumer App

A minimal test app is available at `apps/test-consumer-react/` that demonstrates:

1. kuat-core design tokens loading correctly
2. shadcn Button themed by kuat-core CSS variables
3. Kuat ButtonGroup working alongside shadcn components
4. Dark mode functioning
5. Typography loading (Lexend, Lora, JetBrains Mono)

**Run the test app:**

```bash
cd apps/test-consumer-react
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Architecture Tests

#### Component Source Test

**Prompt:** "I need a Button component for my React app using Kuat. Where should I get it?"

**Expected:**
- Install via shadcn CLI: `npx shadcn@latest add button`
- Theme will be applied automatically via kuat-core CSS variables
- Import from local: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`

**Not expected:**
- Import from `@equal-experts/kuat-react` (deprecated for Button)

**Verification:**
- [ ] Recommends shadcn CLI installation
- [ ] Mentions kuat-core theming
- [ ] Does NOT suggest importing Button from kuat-react

---

#### Kuat Components Test

**Prompt:** "What components should I import from @equal-experts/kuat-react?"

**Expected:**
- ButtonGroup (custom component not in shadcn)
- Future blocks: KuatHeader, KuatFooter, etc.
- Utilities: `cn()`

**Not expected:**
- Button, Dialog, Accordion, Badge (use shadcn directly)

**Verification:**
- [ ] Lists ButtonGroup as primary export
- [ ] Does NOT list standard shadcn components
- [ ] Mentions blocks (coming soon)

---

#### Setup Test

**Prompt:** "How do I set up a new React project with Kuat?"

**Expected:**
1. Install `@equal-experts/kuat-core`
2. Configure Tailwind with kuat preset
3. Import `@equal-experts/kuat-core/variables.css`
4. Initialize shadcn CLI
5. Install shadcn components as needed
6. Optionally install `@equal-experts/kuat-react` for custom components

**Verification:**
- [ ] Mentions kuat-core as foundation
- [ ] Includes shadcn CLI initialization
- [ ] Shows correct import order

---

#### Decision Priority Test

**Prompt:** "I need a search form with a text input and submit button. What should I use?"

**Expected:**
1. Check if Kuat has a block (KuatSearchPattern) - use if available
2. Otherwise use shadcn components (Input, Button) themed by kuat-core
3. Compose them following Kuat patterns

**Verification:**
- [ ] Checks Kuat blocks first
- [ ] Falls back to shadcn components
- [ ] Mentions kuat-core theming
