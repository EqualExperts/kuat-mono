## For AI Content Generation

### Before Generating

Confirm:
1. **Content type** - What format?
2. **Audience** - Who will read this?
3. **Purpose** - What outcome does this serve?
4. **Context** - Do you have enough information?

**If unclear, ask clarifying questions.**

### While Generating

**Do:**
- Use specific examples
- Include evidence when claiming results
- Default to plain English
- Apply appropriate tone for audience

**Don't:**
- Generate generic content
- Make claims without evidence
- Use "revolutionize", "transform", "disrupt" without proof
- Write like typical AI-generated content

### After Generating

Apply quality tests:
1. Clarity Test
2. Purpose Test
3. Consistency Test
4. Audience Test
5. Accessibility Test

**Red flags:**
- Generic phrases applicable to any system
- Lack of specific examples
- Over-use of buzzwords
- Tone mismatch with audience
